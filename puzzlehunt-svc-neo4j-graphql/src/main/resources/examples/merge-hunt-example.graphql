# I tried a variant of this mutation using updateHunt instead of mergeHunt and got nutty results. After the updateHunt
# mutation, the updated node was missing its uuid property. This makes it seem like the generated updateFoo mutations
# are broken, but probably I'm missing something. The generated mergeFoo mutators use the += operator with Cypher's set
# command, while the generated updateFoo mutations use = (and don't specify the ID property). += has
# "update property if non-null value specified, delete property if null value specified, otherwise leave untouched"
# semantics, which seems perfect for an "update" operation.
