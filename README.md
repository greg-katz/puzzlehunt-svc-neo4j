# puzzlehunt-svc-neo4j

TODO: Describe what this repo was/is about


Outline:
- Project goals:
  - Get to "level 1" of experience with Neo4j, GraphQL, and Java's support for those two things
  - Get to "level 1" answers to the questions "what are graph databases good for, and when would you reach for one?"
  - Get to "level 1" answers to the questions "what is GraphQL good for, and when would use reach for it?"
- Non-goals:
  - Production readiness
- Baises:
  - We're Java devs, so we tried to make things work in Java
- Faux problem we solved: Write a service for a ClueKeeper-esque app that stores its data in Neo4j

# What we tried

TODO: List the different combinations of libraries/approaches we tried

# What we concluded

TODO: GraphQL + Neo4j + autogeneration of a single Cipher query for each request + optional overriding of property fetching = seems like a powerful solution that covers a lot of bases

# Learnings about libraries

TODO: What each of the various neo-graphql-java-spring-nani libraries are useful for
